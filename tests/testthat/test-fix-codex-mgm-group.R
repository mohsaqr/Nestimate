# Regression: Codex P2 on the fix diff -- build_network(method="mgm",
# level=, group=) validated the mgm `level` length against raw ncol(data),
# before the group column is dropped for the per-group recursion. A correct
# level was rejected; a group-padded one was forwarded too long to
# .estimator_mgm(). Fix: validate against the modeled-variable count
# (ncol minus the grouping column(s)).
