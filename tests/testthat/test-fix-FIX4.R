# Regression tests for FIX4 — A06 (mcml / mmm) confirmed findings.
#
# A06-F01: build_mcml(type="semi_markov") was byte-identical to type="tna"
#          (no holding-time model exists). Now rejected, not silently aliased.
# A06-F02: type="frequency" is a legitimate raw-count alias of type="raw" —
#          behavior kept, documented as an explicit alias.
# A06-F03: summary.net_mmm @return now documents the data.frame it really
#          returns (regression locks the actual return shape/class/visibility).
# A06-F04: net_aggregate_weights "density" must equal sum / n_possible (true
#          edge density), and differ from "mean" when zero edges are present.
