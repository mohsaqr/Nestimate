# ---- rename_models ----
#
# A `netobject_group` is a named list whose names label each constituent
# network ("Cluster 1", "High", "A", ...). Those labels show up in every
# downstream report (print methods, plot panel titles, bootstrap output,
# permutation tests, etc.), so the group built by `build_network()` may
# need post-hoc renaming once the analyst knows what each cluster
# actually represents.
#
# `rename_models()` is the equivalent of `tna::rename_groups()`. The
# Nestimate name uses "models" because the Nestimate vocabulary refers
# to each constituent of a `netobject_group` as a model (one fitted
# network), reserving "group" for the dispatch class.

#' Rename the models of a `netobject_group`
#'
#' Replaces the names of the constituent networks in a `netobject_group`
#' (or any object inheriting from it). Useful when `build_network()`
#' produced generic labels (e.g. `"Cluster 1"`, `"Cluster 2"`) and you
#' want to substitute meaningful ones (e.g. `"High engagement"`,
#' `"Low engagement"`).
#'
#' @param x A `netobject_group` (or any object inheriting from it, such
#'   as `net_mlvar`).
#' @param new_names A character vector of new names. Must have the same
#'   length as `x`, contain no `NA` or empty strings, and be unique.
#' @return A `netobject_group` of the same class and length as `x`, with
#'   `names()` replaced by `new_names`. The constituent networks are
#'   returned unchanged.
