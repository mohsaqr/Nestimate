# Print Method for net_mmm

Compact summary of a Mixed Markov Model fit. Header carries dimensions
and information criteria; cluster table carries N, mixing share, and
per-cluster average posterior probability (AvePP). Layout matches
[`print.net_clustering`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/Nestimate/reference/print.net_clustering.md)
so distance- and model-based clusterings can be compared at a glance.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'net_mmm'
print(x, digits = 3L, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `net_mmm` object.

- digits:

  Integer. Decimal places for floating-point statistics. Default `3`.
  Non-breaking: `print(x)` keeps the same alignment as before.

- ...:

  Additional arguments (ignored).

## Value

The input object, invisibly.

## Examples

``` r
seqs <- data.frame(V1 = sample(c("A","B","C"), 30, TRUE),
                   V2 = sample(c("A","B","C"), 30, TRUE))
mmm <- build_mmm(seqs, k = 2, n_starts = 1, max_iter = 10, seed = 1)
print(mmm)
