# Fit a Mixed Markov Model

Discovers latent subgroups with different transition dynamics using
Expectation-Maximization. Each mixture component has its own transition
matrix. Sequences are probabilistically assigned to components.

## Usage

``` r
build_mmm(
  data,
  k = 2L,
  n_starts = 50L,
  max_iter = 200L,
  tol = 1e-06,
  smooth = 0.01,
  seed = NULL,
  covariates = NULL,
  covariate_effect = c("em", "posthoc"),
  estimator = c("auto", "firth", "multinom", "chisq")
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data.frame (wide format), `netobject`, or `tna` model. For tna
  objects, extracts the stored data.

- k:

  Integer. Whole finite number of mixture components, \>= 2. Default: 2.

- n_starts:

  Integer. Positive whole finite number of random restarts. Default: 50.

- max_iter:

  Integer. Positive whole finite maximum EM iterations per start.
  Default: 200.

- tol:

  Numeric. Finite positive convergence tolerance. Default: 1e-6.

- smooth:

  Numeric. Finite non-negative Laplace smoothing constant. Default:
  0.01.

- seed:

  Integer or NULL. Random seed.

- covariates:

  Optional. Covariates integrated into the EM algorithm to model
  covariate-dependent mixing proportions. Accepts a string, character
  vector, formula, or data.frame (same forms as
  [`build_clusters`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/build_clusters.md)).
  For `netobject` or `cograph_network` input, names are resolved against
  `$metadata` first, so a typical call is
  `build_mmm(net, k = 3, covariates = "session_label")`. Unlike the
  post-hoc analysis in
  [`build_clusters()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/build_clusters.md),
  these covariates directly influence cluster membership during EM
  estimation (see `covariate_effect`).

- covariate_effect:

  How `covariates` enter the model. `"em"` (default) folds them into the
  EM as covariate-dependent mixing proportions, so they shape the
  cluster fit itself (and rows with missing covariates are dropped
  before fitting). `"posthoc"` fits a plain mixture on every sequence
  and uses the covariates only for the after-fit multinomial logit, so
  covariate values — and their missingness — never change which clusters
  are found. Ignored when `covariates` is `NULL`.

- estimator:

  Multinomial fitter for the post-hoc covariate analysis (does not
  affect EM): `"auto"` (default) inspects the cluster x covariate
  cross-tab and falls back to `"firth"` only when any cell has fewer
  than 5 observations (separation risk), otherwise the much faster
  `"multinom"`; `"firth"` forces Firth's penalised likelihood via
  [`brglm2::brmultinom`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/brglm2/man/brmultinom.html)
  (finite under separation); `"multinom"` forces
  [`nnet::multinom`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/nnet/man/multinom.html) (warns
  about separation risk); `"chisq"` runs descriptive tests (no logit).
  See
  [`build_clusters`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/build_clusters.md)
  for full details.

## Value

An object of class `net_mmm` with components:

- data:

  The full N-row sequence frame used for estimation.

- models:

  List of `netobject`s, one per component. Each component carries the
  rows assigned to that component in its `$data` slot, while its
  transition matrix is the EM-estimated component transition matrix.

- k:

  Number of components.

- mixing:

  Numeric vector of mixing proportions.

- posterior:

  N x k matrix of posterior probabilities.

- assignments:

  Integer vector of hard assignments (1..k).

- quality:

  List: `avepp` (per-class), `avepp_overall`, `entropy`,
  `relative_entropy`, `classification_error`.

- log_likelihood, BIC, AIC, ICL:

  Model fit statistics.

- states:

  Character vector of state names.

## Initial states

The first sequence column has special status: it is read directly as the
per-sequence initial state
(`init_state[i] <- match(raw_data[i, state_cols[1L]], states)`). The
function does **not** scan forward to the first non-missing position,
and it does not apply any `na_syms`-style symbol conversion (unlike
[`build_clusters`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/build_clusters.md)).
The state vocabulary is built from the unique non-`NA` values across all
columns, so if your data uses a sentinel character such as `"*"` or
`"%"` for missing cells, that sentinel becomes a real state and the
first column reads it as a valid initial state. If you want padded
leading missings to be treated as missing, recode them to `NA` before
calling `build_mmm()` (then
[`match()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/match.html) returns `NA`, which the
EM treats as an uninformative initial distribution), or left-trim the
leading missings so each sequence's first column carries an observed
state.
