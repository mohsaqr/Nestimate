# Higher-order hypergraph from a network's clique structure

Takes a network and produces a hypergraph by promoting k-cliques (k \>=
3) to k-hyperedges. Each k-clique is independently included as a
k-hyperedge with probability `p`. Optionally retains the underlying
pairwise edges as 2-hyperedges. Foundation for higher-order analyses.

## Usage

``` r
build_hypergraph(
  net,
  p = 1,
  method = c("clique", "vr"),
  include_pairwise = TRUE,
  max_size = 3L,
  threshold = 0,
  seed = NULL
)

# S3 method for class 'net_hypergraph'
print(x, ...)

# S3 method for class 'net_hypergraph'
summary(object, ...)
```

## Arguments

- net:

  A `netobject`, `cograph_network`, `simplicial_complex`, or numeric
  adjacency / weight matrix. Directed inputs are symmetrised by the
  underlying clique enumerator.

- p:

  Probability in `[0, 1]` that each k-clique with k \>= 3 becomes a
  k-hyperedge. Default `1` (deterministic — every found clique is
  included).

- method:

  One of `"clique"` (cliques in the binarised adjacency) or `"vr"`
  (Vietoris-Rips: cliques in the weight \>= threshold graph). Default
  `"clique"`.

- include_pairwise:

  Logical. Include 2-edges from the input network as 2-hyperedges.
  Default `TRUE`. Set `FALSE` for a "fully higher-order" hypergraph
  containing only k-hyperedges with k \>= 3.

- max_size:

  Integer \>= 2. Maximum hyperedge size to extract. Default `3L`
  (triangles only). `4L` also includes 4-cliques as 4-hyperedges, etc.

- threshold:

  Numeric. Edge weight cutoff used to binarise the adjacency for clique
  enumeration. Default `0` (any non-zero weight is an edge).

- seed:

  Optional integer for reproducible Bernoulli sampling when `0 < p < 1`.

- x:

  A `net_hypergraph` object (for `print`).

- ...:

  Additional arguments (ignored).

- object:

  A `net_hypergraph` object (for `summary`).

## Value

A `net_hypergraph` object: a list with components

- `hyperedges`:

  List of integer vectors. Each entry is a hyperedge given as the sorted
  node indices it spans.

- `incidence`:

  Numeric matrix of size `n_nodes` x `n_hyperedges`.
  `incidence[i, j] = 1` iff node i belongs to hyperedge j. Row names are
  node names; column names are `h1`, `h2`, ...

- `nodes`:

  Character vector of node names.

- `n_nodes`, `n_hyperedges`:

  Scalar counts.

- `size_distribution`:

  Named integer vector: number of hyperedges of each size, named
  `size_2`, `size_3`, ...

- `params`:

  Recorded call parameters: `method`, `p`, `include_pairwise`,
  `max_size`, `threshold`, `seed`.

The input `x` invisibly.

The input `object` invisibly.

## Details

The construction follows Burgio, Matamalas, Gomez & Arenas (2020) on
simplicial / hypergraph contagion. For each k-clique with k \>= 3 found
in the underlying graph (via
[`build_simplicial()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/Nestimate/reference/build_simplicial.md)),
an independent Bernoulli(`p`) trial decides whether that clique becomes
a k-hyperedge. Underlying pairwise edges are always retained when
`include_pairwise = TRUE`, so the resulting hypergraph contains both the
original 2-edge structure and the sampled higher-order interactions.

At the limits:

- `p = 0` with `include_pairwise = TRUE` reproduces the input pairwise
  network as a hypergraph of size-2 edges.

- `p = 1` with `include_pairwise = FALSE` returns a fully higher-order
  hypergraph containing only the k-hyperedges (k \>= 3) found in the
  network's clique complex.
